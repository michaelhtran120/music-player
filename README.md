# M's Music

[Live Site](https://music-player-ten-gray.vercel.app/)

This is a music app where I can share some music not found on streaming platforms. I really have a deep love and appreciation for music and would love to share some of the music I have discovered over the years that is difficult to find.

The goal is to sift through my collection of music that I have accumulated over the years (prior to streaming), and updating the code base with new songs every so often.

If you find the music here awesome and would like to discuss music with me, please reach out!

If you are the artist/producer of the track and would like things to be removed, please let me know. 

## Retrospect

A part of this was building out an audio player from scratch, which I used some resources for reference. The area I had a hard time was getting the animation of the progress bar correct/adjusted for each song. Also trying to figure out how to get the marquee animation working as well took a bit of trial and error.

I also have been curious about the Next JS framework and I wanted to see how this framework can be used and how it can save time. Overall I feel like I had a introductory exposure to Next JS, but enjoy how it has a lot of tools included out of the box. 

Overall it was great React and Sass practice. It was awesome to try out the API feature as well as the integrated router.

## For Developers
If you would like to play around with the code, feel free to clone the repository and you can type "npm run dev" to run in development mode.

As of now I have no plans to really build this or expand this application as it solves the problem I had. (Plus it was fun to build out the audio player).
